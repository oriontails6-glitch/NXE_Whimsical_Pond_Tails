   ============================================================
   TO ADD A NEW CHARACTER:
   1. Drop their image into the /images folder (e.g. images/newduck.jpg)
   2. Copy one object below, paste it into the right section array,
      and edit the fields.
   3. Save. Refresh the page (or push to GitHub). That's it —
      no HTML/CSS editing needed.

   FIELDS:
   - img:      path to the image inside the /images folder
   - name:     character's front name (shown on the front of the card)
   - backName: character's back name (shown on the back when flipped; defaults to name if omitted)
   - role:     short title/tagline (shown under the name, front of card)
   - bio:      funny 1-2 sentence bio (shown on the back when flipped)

   SECTIONS:
   Add a character to one of the three arrays below: ELDERS,
   FAMILY, or DUCKLINGS. Want a whole new section (e.g. "Pets" or
   "Villains")? Scroll to the bottom of this file — there's a
   3-line example showing how to register a new section too.
